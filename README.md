TriangleDraw is brilliant for sketching logos. You can quickly create designs 
that can be used for branding on letterheads or on your website.

### Primary features:

- Draw: use one finger to draw black/white triangles.
- Pinch: use two fingers to zoom.


### Secondary features:

- Browser: Organize your drawing files in directories. Rename. Duplicate.
- Canvas: There are 11616 triangles; you have plenty of space for all kinds of symbols/logos.
- Rotate the canvas by 60 degrees.
- Flip the canvas around the x axis or the y axis.
- Invert, so white becomes black and black becomes white.
- Move the canvas by one column/row. The triangles wraps around the canvas edge.
- Symmetry modes: x, y, xy, 3 way, 6 way.
- Undo: If something goes wrong, then you can roll back to the moment just before it went wrong.
- Fullscreen: Hide the toolbars and work without noise.
- Export to Vector (PDF): You get the highest possible quality with vector graphics, that you can import into PhotoShop/Illustrator.
- Export to bitmap: A 2048x2048 image that can be saved to the photo album or shared on social media.

# Development of TriangleDraw

Greetings from Simon Strandgaard. I'm the developer of TriangleDraw. It has been my hobby project for many years.

It began around year 2004, where I first learned about [.werkkzeug](https://www.pouet.net/prod.php?which=12511), 
a very powerful tool for composing digital art, by the 
german demo group [Farbrausch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farbrausch).

I developed my own demotool for macOS, named GraphicDesignerToolbox (aka. GDT), that had building blocks 
that could be stacked the same way as in .werkkzeug. For GDT I made a few building blocks for working with vector paths.

When the iPad arrived around 2010, I developed the first version of TriangleDraw, that was inspired by 1 of the 
vector building blocks in GDT. I soon after released TriangleDraw version 1. It had a tiny tiny canvas. It only worked on iPad.
No support for iPhone. I had no luck selling the app.

Around year 2014 I had TriangleDraw version 2 ready. The canvas was much larger. It worked on iPhone+iPad. 
I experimented with In-app-purchases, but I still had no luck earning any money on version 2.

Around year 2018/2019 I migrated TriangleDraw from ObjectiveC to Swift. The `UIDocumentBrowserViewController` is used. 
And best of all, it's free and open source. Please consider contributing to TriangleDraw.
